# MediaFiler

A Python 2.7 GUI app to organize media files. 

This app helps you to organize your images (and, somewhat, videos). It puts the images into a date-based hierarchy of directories, based on their capture date (as recorded in the image EXIF data). It helps you to organize your media with your own tags.
